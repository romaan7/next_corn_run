# next_corn_run
For each valid job entry in corntab finds the                   soonest  time  at which each of the  commands                   will fire and whether it is today or tomorrow.

We have a set of tasks, each running at least daily, which are scheduled using some simple
values in a text file. You might recognise this from writing a crontab configuration in the past.
Examples of the scheduler config:
30 1 /bin/run_me_daily
45 * /bin/run_me_hourly
* * /bin/run_me_every_minute
* 19 /bin/run_me_sixty_times
The first field is the minute past the hour, the second field is the hour of the day and the third is
the command to run. For both cases * means that it should run for all values of that field. In the
above example run_me_daily has been set to run at 1:30am every day and run_me_hourly at
45 minutes past the hour every hour. The fields are whitespace separated and each entry is on
a separate line.
We want you to write a command line program that takes a single argument. This argument is
the simulated 'current time' in the format HH:MM. The program should accept config lines in the
form above to STDIN and output the soonest time at which each of the commands will fire and
whether it is today or tomorrow. In the case when the task should fire at the simulated 'current
time' then that is the time you should output, not the next one.
For example given the above examples as input and the simulated 'current time' command-line
argument 16:10 the output should be:
1:30 tomorrow - /bin/run_me_daily
16:45 today - /bin/run_me_hourly
16:10 today - /bin/run_me_every_minute
19:00 today - /bin/run_me_sixty_times
You can submit your solution in any language you like. Python, PHP, C, JavaScript, Go, Rust,
Swift, Awk, Prolog, using the standard libraries that are part of that language (i.e. no 3rd
party libraries for this task please!). The choice is yours as long as we can run it as described
below.
We will want to run your code, so please supply instructions for building and running it.
Additionally, it must work on at least one of OS X or Linux.
We want to run your code on the command line using an input like
./<your app> HH:MM < config
For example: ./application.py 16:10 < config
